# dirty_ratio
# Contains, as a percentage of total available memory that contains free pages
# and reclaimable pages, the number of pages at which a process which is
# generating disk writes will itself start writing out dirty data.
# The total available memory is not equal to total system memory.

# swappiness
# This control is used to define how aggressive the kernel will swap
# memory pages.  Higher values will increase aggressiveness, lower values
# decrease the amount of swap.  A value of 0 instructs the kernel not to
# initiate swap until the amount of free and file-backed pages is less
# than the high water mark in a zone.
# The default value is 60.
